# eCommerce_ORM
This app provides the backend for an e-commerce site. The user is able to set up a database using mysql and seed the database using 'npm run seed'. This creates four tables: categories, products, tags, and a product-tag key table. The user is able to make get, update, post, and delete requests on the categories, products, and tags tables to an api on the local server.
